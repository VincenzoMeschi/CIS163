# Non-Attacking n-Queens

# Imagine an nxn chessboard on which you wish to place n queens such that no queen can attack another.

# A queen can attack another queen if they are either:

#     in the same column
#     in the same row
#     on the same diagonal (e.g. can reach one another by following a straight diagonal line)

# Your Task

# Using recursion, implement the function below called count that counts the number of ways in which
# queens can be placed on an nxn chessboard such that no queens can attack each other.

# For example, for n = 4
# there are two ways two place the 4 queens on the board such that none can attack. Below are the only two ways that queens can be placed on a board.


# def count(n):
#    pass


# def count_helper(n, pos, board):
#    staring_board = [[] for _ in range(n)] * n
#    pass


# print([[[] for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)])
